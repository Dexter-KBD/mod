## Adept + 57-68 mm ball

> ❗️ not [ISO-2025EFOG](https://github.com/efogdev/ISO-2025EFOG) compliant

## Spacers

You need spacers for 50-57mm balls, see the README in the directory.

## FAQ

Please refer to [the README](https://github.com/adept-anyball/mod/blob/master/50-52.5mm%20ball/README.md) for 50-52.5 mm ball. \
Main differences: there is no smooth version, there is no version without magnets (I don't think it makes sense). \
The recommended buttons are H950 Hn6 (Hn = H<sub>negative</sub>, see [this README](https://github.com/adept-anyball/mod/blob/master/50-52.5mm%20ball/rev%202/raised-buttons/README.md)).

## Adept + 50-57 mm ball 

> ❗️ not [ISO-2025EFOG](https://github.com/efogdev/ISO-2025EFOG) compliant

This is basically the [57-68mm version](https://github.com/adept-anyball/mod/tree/master/57-68mm%20ball%20(50-60mm%20with%20spacers)) but with it's "spacers" and "insert" baked into the model itself. 

## Everything?

Everything. Even the sensor cover, the bottom part, the "default" buttons. \
You need to split those in your slicer before printing. 

## FAQ

Q: Are all the parts required? \
A: The bottom part and buttons are optional. 

Q: Is the bottom part different too? \
A: The stock bottom part is 100% compatible but the version here is 1.2 mm lower. You can cover the new hole with any tape to protect the sensor chip from dust.

Q: Where are other buttons? \
A: The buttons here are the same as in the [57-68mm version](https://github.com/adept-anyball/mod/tree/master/57-68mm%20ball%20(50-60mm%20with%20spacers)/raised-buttons).

# FAQ
Q: `rev1` or `rev2`? \
A: `rev2`

Q: What's with the "bottom" and "sensor-cover"? \
A: Sensor cover is required to print. `Bottom` is the bottom part but lower, it is optional.

Q: Can I print "magnets" version if I don't have magnets yet? \
A: Yeah it actually is very usable even with magnets not inserted.

Q: Do I need to populate all the 11 magnets for the wrist rest? \
A: I believe 5 should be enough. You can try as low as 3 tho.

## `Flat` vs `Magnets`
Flat version is just like the default one. The one marked as "magnets" includes slots for 4x2 mm magnets to attach raised buttons and wrist rest.

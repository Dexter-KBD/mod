## Adept + 50-52.5 mm ball

> ❗️ not [ISO-2025EFOG](https://github.com/efogdev/ISO-2025EFOG) compliant

## FAQ
Q: `rev1` or `rev2`? \
A: `rev2` 

Q: What does "50-52.5 mm" mean? \
A: `rev1` is compatible only with 50 mm ball, `rev2` should work with any diameter within the range.

Q: What's with the "bottom" and "sensor-cover"? \
A: Sensor cover is required to print. Bottom is the bottom part but slightly lower, it is optional.

Q: Can I print "magnets" version if I don't have magnets yet? \
A: Yeah it actually is very usable even with magnets not inserted.

Q: Do I need to populate all the 11 magnets for the wrist rest? \
A: I believe 5 should be enough. You can try as low as 3 tho.

Q: STEP or STL? \
A: I recommend using STL for slicer and STEP for CAD.

## Layer height
1. Top (Smooth), buttons, wrist rest: 0.1-0.12 mm

## `Flat` vs `Magnets`
Flat version is just like the default one. \
The one marked as "magnets" includes slots for magnets to attach raised buttons and wrist rest. \
Magnets required: 4x2 mm, 24 pcs for the buttons and 3/5/7/11 pcs for the wrist rest. \

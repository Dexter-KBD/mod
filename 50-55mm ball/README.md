> ✅ [ISO-2025EFOG](https://github.com/efogdev/ISO-2025EFOG) compliant

## Everything?

Everything. Even the sensor cover, the bottom part, the "default" buttons. \
**You need to split those in your slicer before printing.** \
The bottom part is optional and is 100% compatible with the default Ploopy bottom.

## FAQ

Q: Layer height? \
A: Use 0.1-0.12mm for the buttons and 0.2mm for everything else.

Q: Where are other buttons? \
A: [Here](https://github.com/adept-anyball/mod/tree/master/buttons).

Q: I don't have magnets, is it usable? \
A: Yes, it is very usable even with magnets not inserted. 

Q: 57mm ball pretty please??? \
A: Might work with 0.4mm spacers. I haven't tried that. 

Q: Why is the bottom part even here? \
A: It is 1.2mm lower but has the sensor chip exposed. It is recommended to cover the hole with any tape. 

Q: top-for-non-standard-SP8-BTUs.stl \
A: Pretty self-explanatory, isn't it? There's no sensor cover model for this version yet.

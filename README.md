# Ploopy Adept mod for 8mm ball BTUs 
All the models here are made to be used with BOSCH Rexroth BTUs.

## Printing
I highly recommend using STL files,not STEP. Slic3r-based slicers don't work perfectly with Onshape STEP's for some reason. \
Consider layer height of 0.15 or 0.2 mm for the sharp version and 0.12 mm for the smooth one.

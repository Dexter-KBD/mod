# Ploopy Adept mod for 8mm ball BTUs 
All the models here are made to be used with BOSCH Rexroth BTUs.

## Printing
I highly recommend using STL files, not STEP. Slic3r-based slicers don't work perfectly with OnShape STEPs for some reason. \
Consider layer height of 0.15 or 0.2 mm for the sharp version and 0.12 mm for the smooth one.

## 44/45 mm ball

>Please take a look at [this](https://makerworld.com/en/models/1087275) model at Makerworld, it's the same mod but better.

# Ploopy Adept mod for 8mm ball BTUs 

## Files
All the models here are made to be used with BOSCH Rexroth BTUs. \
`Adept` — for the original ball size
`Adept 50 mm` — for 50 mm ball

## Printing
I highly recommend using STL file and not the STEP one. Slic3r-based slicers don't work perfectly with Onshape STEP's. Also, consider layer height of 0.15 mm or 0.2 mm.

## Differences
2 mm taller. That's it! For the 55mm version, it's a different story. Buttons are smaller and thinner (not by a lot), and it's even taller.

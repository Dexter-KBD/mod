# Beginner Guide: What You Need to Prepare for the Ploopy Adept Mod

## 1. Ploopy Adept PCB

You can either purchase a [fully assembled version](https://ploopy.co/shop/adept-trackball-fully-assembled/)
 from the official Ploopy website or build one yourself using the [open-source files](https://github.com/ploopyco/adept-trackball/tree/master/hardware/electronics)
. If you're a beginner and unfamiliar with soldering or hardware, I recommend buying the prebuilt version. If you're an experienced builder, you probably don’t need my advice.

3. Case for the Mod
You need only the top and bottom parts. The original sensor cover is reused. If you're not buying the prebuilt version from the official site and are instead building your own PCB, you will also need the sensor cover. (It's mainly for dust protection, so the device will still function without it.)

4. Buttons
Choose buttons that fit your hand and print them. Here's a link with various button options. The best approach is to use the original Adept buttons, get used to how the trackball works, and then determine which height suits each button. Note: if you're using the 55mm mod, the trackball sits higher, so the back buttons need to be taller. I recommend printing extras in different heights to test. The linked files already include buttons of different heights and angles.
I printed both the case and buttons using PA12 MJF at JLC3DP. I'll explain how to order from them below.

5. Magnets
You’ll need round magnets with 4mm diameter and 2mm height for the case and buttons. Some cheap magnets may be only 1.7mm thick. Try to find ones that are closer to 2mm based on product reviews. 1.7mm still works, but if you want stronger attachment, go for 2mm. I bought mine from Taobao, but Amazon or local hardware stores should have them too.

6. BTUs (Ball Transfer Units)
Use the Rexroth brand. I do not recommend other brands. Over 90% of the mod’s quality depends on the BTU. You can use alternatives, but I haven’t tested them—so issues may arise. Discuss in the Discord if you want to know more. If Rexroth is available in your country, please use it. I ordered mine from a supplier with the cheapest shipping, which took 3 weeks, but it arrived safely.

7. Ball
You cannot use the original 45mm ball. Prepare a 50–55mm ball instead. I'm currently using a 52.5mm snooker ball and a 55mm Sanwa trackball, both of which work great.

8. Palm Rest (Optional)
When using the original Adept, I didn’t need a palm rest. However, the BTU mod raises the height and makes the ball much smoother, which made precise control harder without wrist support. I designed and shared a palm rest that fits my hand. Printing with MJF isn’t cheap, so feel free to explore cheaper alternatives like wood or acrylic.

9. Anti-slip Bumpers (Optional)
The bottom of the case has small holes designed for bumpers to prevent sliding. Depending on your desk surface, you might not need them. But I included the option. If needed, use bumpers no larger than 9mm in diameter.

10. Adhesive for Magnets
You don’t have to use super glue, but you'll need something to attach the magnets to the case and buttons.

11. Screws
You can reuse the screws from the original Adept. If you need more, use #2 3/8" screws. I personally used M2.2 9.5mm screws.

12. LEGO Bricks
Yes, you’ll need a LEGO brick to fit into the 6 o’clock position of the case. Prepare a few small ones (1x1 or 1x3 size).

How to Order from JLC3DP

You’ve probably already downloaded the required files. Go to the site, log in, and drag & drop the files. STEP or STL files are both fine. I uploaded STEP files (STL versions were shared upon user request).

Select the same options as shown in the image.

Be sure to check the box for accepting thin wall risks. It's usually not an issue. In my first prototype (0.9mm thickness), one button spring broke. Now I’ve improved it to 1.2mm, so the risk is lower.

Even if you check the box, JLC may still email you for confirmation regarding thin walls. Just confirm and proceed.

Yes, MJF isn’t cheap. But compared to FDM PLA, it guarantees much better surface quality. If you're curious about the types of 3D printing, I recommend watching some YouTube videos or doing a bit of research. Each printing method has its pros and cons—too much to cover here.

Select “Product Desc” when ordering. It’s for customs in your country. You don’t need to match my screenshot exactly. These parts aren’t banned, so you don’t need to worry.

For buttons: prepare each button as a separate file or merge them manually. Orders with multiple shells in one file will be rejected. If you’re a beginner reading this, just export one button at a time as a STEP file and only print what you need.

Double-check everything before placing your order.
JLC engineers will review your files before production. As mentioned, if there are thin walls, you’ll get a confirmation email. Be sure to reply, or the order won’t proceed.

Since manufacturing is done in China, I’m not sure how current US import tariffs may affect you—hopefully there won’t be any additional cost.

Once the package arrives, your preparation is complete.  
See you in the assembly guide!

# Adept 44-45mm short mod

This model is changes both the top and the bottom of the case. The optics cover it still compatible with the original one.
The main differences from this mod and the original case is that it is slightly shorter and the top and bottom are aligned. In the original model, the bottom is smaller then the top. The case is designed to fit the original 45mm pool ball, but it should also work with a 44mm ball.

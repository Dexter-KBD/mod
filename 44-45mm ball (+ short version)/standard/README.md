# Adept 44-45 standard mod

This mod only changes the top case of the Ploopy Adept to fit the Rexroth BTUs. So you only need to print the top and all the other parts will just fit. The case is designed to fit the original 45mm pool ball, but it should also work with a 44mm ball.

There are 2 models here to choose from:

- top-45mm-magnets: which has holes for the 4x2mm magnets and complies with ISO-2025EFOG
- top-45mm: which is the standard case without magnet holes

Both models have STEP and STL files for you to choose between.
